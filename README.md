# Adaptive Indoor Localisation System

## Introduction

The Adpative Indoor Localisation System (AILS) is aimed to request the current location of a person within an organisation. Although the design allows the use of different technologies, this version uses WiFi data of the access points surrounding the user to determine his/her current location.

The goal of the AILS project is to provide a reference implementation of the INAETICS architecture and to demonstrate its potential and to stress its architecture on scalability using heterogeneous devices.

AILS is based on a client/server architecture where the client runs on an Android device. Both the client and server run on Felix, the java implementation of OSGi. The server uses all core technologies of INAETICS, knowingly Felix (as the OSGi implementation), Vagrant, etcd, Docker, ACE and Kubernetes.
